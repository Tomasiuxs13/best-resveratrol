          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you make a purchase after clicking through from our website. When you click an affiliate link and buy a product, the retailer pays us a small percentage of the sale at no extra cost to you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Using our affiliate links does not increase the price you pay. In many cases, you may even find exclusive discounts through our links.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While we earn commissions from affiliate sales, <strong>this does not influence our editorial content, product reviews, or rankings.</strong> Our recommendations are based on:

            We only recommend products we believe provide genuine value to our readers. If a product doesn't meet our quality standards, we won't recommend it regardless of commission rates. Our goal is to help you make informed decisions, not to maximize our earnings.

            Our product rankings are NOT influenced by which products pay higher commissions. We rank products based on objective criteria including purity, potency, value, and user satisfaction. The #1 ranked product may not be our highest-earning affiliate link.
